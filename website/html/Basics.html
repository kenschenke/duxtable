<h2>DuxTable Basics</h2>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> component implements a table using CSS FlexBox layout.  It comes with built-in
    support for resizable columns, searching, pagination, sorting, and fixed column header with scrolling contents.
    There are many options controlling behavior, appearance, and how the user is allowed to interact with the table.
    Following is a short example showing <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> at its simplest.  This example displays a few
    thousand randomly generated addresses.  The contents are paginated automatically, the columns can be resized, and
    the rows sorted by clicking on the column headers.  In addition, rows are filtered as the user types in the
    search field.
</p>

<h3>Table Data</h3>

<p>
    The data for the table rows is provided in the <code>data</code> property to the DuxTable component as an array
    of JavaScript objects.  DuxTable only needs to know two things about each row in the array: the property that
    uniquely identifies each row and how to render each cell.
</p>

<h4>The rowKey Property</h4>

<p>
    The <code>rowKey</code> property to DuxTable specifies the property in each row object that uniquely identifies the
    row.  This is usually a corresponding database ID but can be anything.  Here is an example of how the table data
    might be represented.
</p>

<pre>
    const rows = [
        {
            Id: 346,
            Name: 'John Doe',
            Email: 'johndoe@example.com'
        },
        {
            Id: 5645,
            Name: 'Jane Doe',
            Email: 'janedoe@example.com'
        },
        {
            Id: 4564,
            Name: 'Bill Smith',
            Email: 'billsmith@example.com
        }
    ];

    &lt;DuxTable rowKey="Id" data={rows} .../&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Cell Rendering</h4>

<p>
    DuxTable needs to know how to render the contents of each cell in a row.  This is handled by specifying the
    table columns.
</p>

<h3>Table Columns</h3>

<p>
    The columns are defined in the <code>columns</code> property to DuxTable as an array of JavaScript objects.  The
    objects have several optional properties and only one required property: <code>title</code>.  Here is a list of
    the properties followed by an example of a columns array in use.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th width="150">Default Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>title</td>
        <td>(required)</td>
        <td>The title of the column shown in the column header</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>field</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This is the field in the row object to render in the cell.  In the above example, this could be
            <code>Name</code> or <code>Email</code>.  If no custom rendering is necessary, this is the easiest way
            to display cell contents.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>render</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This property specifies a function to call to render the cell contents.  The function is passed the object
            for the row from the array provided in the <code>data</code> property.  It can return a string or a
            React component.  See the topic on Custom Cell Rendering for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>align</td>
        <td>left</td>
        <td>This specifies the text alignment in the cell: "left", "center", or "right".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>width</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            DuxTable automatically calculates column sizes based on the width of the table. This property specifies
            the width in pixels of the column.  Columns without a specified width are sized equally.  The user is
            allowed to resize columns by dragging the divider in the column header.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sortable</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>
            By setting this property to false, the user will not be allowed to click in the column header to sort the
            table by this column.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sortCallback</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            If present, this function will be called when the user clicks on the column header to sort the table by
            this column.  See the topic on Row Sorting for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>footer</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This specifies a value or React component to render as a footer for this column.  See the topic on Footers
            for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Example Columns Array</h4>

<pre>
    const cols = [
        {
            field: 'Name',
            title: 'Name
        },
        {
            field: 'Addr',
            title: 'Address'
        },
        {
            field: 'CitySt',
            title: 'City, State',
            width: 200
        },
        {
            field: 'Orders',
            title: 'Orders',
            width: 100,
            align: 'right
        }
    ];
</pre>
