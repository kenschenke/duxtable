<h2>DuxTable Basics</h2>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> component implements a table using CSS FlexBox layout.  It comes with built-in
    support for resizable columns, searching, pagination, sorting, and fixed column header with scrolling contents.
    There are many options controlling behavior, appearance, and how the user is allowed to interact with the table.
    Following is a short example showing <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> at its simplest.  This example displays a few
    thousand randomly generated addresses.  The contents are paginated automatically, the columns can be resized, and
    the rows sorted by clicking on the column headers.  In addition, rows are filtered as the user types in the
    search field.

<p>
    The default CSS styles are designed for a "light mode" web site, but <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> can be
    styled using CSS. The example shows a table in the default "light mode".  You can toggle on "dark mode" to see
    how a table can be integrated into different designs, such as this site.
