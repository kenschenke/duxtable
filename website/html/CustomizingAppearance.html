<h2>Customizing Appearance</h2>

<p>
    The appearance of <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> is controlled entirely using CSS.  Every component uses a CSS
    class that can be overridden.  See the <em>DuxTable Basics</em> topic for a quick example of how easily appearance
    can be changed.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    If you are using webpack, it might be tempting to simply <code>import</code> the duxtable.css file.  This is
    perfectly fine but will not allow you to override the CSS.  This is because the CSS is applied by React during
    component creation.  See the <em>Getting Started</em> topic for more information on using the
    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to reference the CSS in a way that it can be overridden.
</div>

<p>
    Below is every CSS class used by DuxTable.  The classes are named in a way that will be familiar to anyone that
    has used the traditional HTML <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element.  However, DuxTable is built using CSS FlexBox,
    not HTML tables.  This might be important for CSS styling.
