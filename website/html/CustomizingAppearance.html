<h2>Customizing Appearance</h2>

<p>
    The appearance of <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> is controlled entirely using CSS.  Every component uses a CSS
    class that can be overridden.  For a complete list of the CSS rules see the <code>src/duxtable.css</code> file
    in the <a href="https://www.github.com/kenschenke/duxtable">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    If you are using webpack, it might be tempting to simply <code>import</code> the duxtable.css file.  This is
    perfectly fine but will not allow you to override the CSS.  This is because the CSS is applied by React during
    component creation.  See the <em>Getting Started</em> topic for more information on using the
    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to reference the CSS in a way that it can be overridden.

<p>
    The default CSS styles are designed for a "light mode" web site, but <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> can be
    styled using CSS. The example shows a table in the default "light mode".  You can toggle on "dark mode" to see
    how a table can be integrated into different designs, such as this site.
