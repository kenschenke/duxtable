<h2>Fixed-Header Scrolling Tables</h2>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> tables can scroll the contents of the table body with the column headers remaining
    in place.  The table could potentially display a large number of rows.  Please keep browser performance in mind.
    There are a few properties to set for a fixed-header table.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Default Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>pagination</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>Set this property to false to disable pagination</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>bodyHeight</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>This is how many pixels high to make the visible portion of the table body.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
