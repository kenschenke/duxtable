<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    If you're the ready, fire, aim type (aren't all programmers?), you should find everything you need on this page
    and the topics under DuxTable Basics to start using DuxTable.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<pre>
    npm install duxtable
</pre>

<p>
    You also need to link to the <code>duxtable.css</code> file in the <code>node_modules/duxtable/website/dist/</code>
    directory.
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="duxtable.css"/&gt;
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    You might be tempted to use the duxtable.css file in your project with webpack and an import statement.
    This will work as long as you don't need to override any of the CSS in the file.
</div>

<h4>Redux Store</h4>

<p>
    DuxTable stores table state in the Redux store. It requires the root <code>duxtable</code> object in the store.
    A reducer is supplied to manage this.
</p>

<pre>
    import {DuxTableReducer} from 'duxtable';

    const appReducer = combineReducers({
        ...  // other reducers
        duxtable: DuxTableReducer
    });
</pre>

<h4>Browser Requirements</h4>

<p>
    DuxTable requires a browser with support for CSS FlexBox.  It has been tested on the modern evergreen
    browsers (Chrome and Firefox) as well as Internet Explorer 11.  It definitely won't work on
    Internet Explorer 10 or earlier.
