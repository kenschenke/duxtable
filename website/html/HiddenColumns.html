<h2>Hidden Columns</h2>

<p>
    Columns in the table can be hidden or shown based on the dynamic needs of the application or the width of the
    browser window. This is handled with the <code>hidden</code> property in the columns array supplied to DuxTable.
</p>

<p>
    The hidden property for a column can be a boolean value, a function that returns a boolean value, or an object
    that specifies whether or not a column is hidden based on width of the browser window. The width breakpoints are
    the same as defined in Bootstrap 4.  The breakpoints are listed below.  Following is a sample columns array.
</p>

<pre>
    const isColumnHidden = () => {
        return true;
    }

    const columns = [
        {
            title: 'Column 1',
            field: 'col1value',
            hidden: false
        },
        {
            title: 'Hidden Column',
            field: 'hiddenvalue',
            hidden: isColumnHidden
        }
    ];
</pre>

<h3>Responsive Breakpoints</h3>

<p>
    A column can be dymanically shown or hidden based on the width of the browser window.  This is done by specifying
    an object with boolean values for various widths.  The breakpoints are the same as those in Bootstrap 4.  These
    breakpoints are:
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Breakpoint</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>xs</td>
        <td>Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sm</td>
        <td>Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>md</td>
        <td>Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>lg</td>
        <td>Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>xl</td>
        <td>Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    A breakpoint object might look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
    const hidden = {
        xs: true,
        sm: true,
        md: false
    };
</pre>

<p>
    Notice the hidden object is missing <code>lg</code> and <code>xl</code>. If a size breakpoint is missing from the
    object, the breakpoint for the next smallest screen size is used. In this case, browsers with large or extra-large
    windows would fall back to the medium breakpoint.  The column would be hidden on small and extra-small browser
    windows. If the browser window is the <code>xs</code> size and that breakpoint is missing from the object, the
    next lowest breakpoint is used instead.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
    In this example, the columns hide at browser widths more narrow than their breakpoint.  For example, the Column Xl
    will be hidden when the browser window is smaller than xl.  Try resizing the browser window to see the columns
    hide and show.
