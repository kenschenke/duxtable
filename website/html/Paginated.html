<h2>Paginated Tables</h2>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxTable&gt;</code> comes with built-in support for pagination.  The entire set of rows is provided in
    the <code>data</code> property and DuxTable splits it into manageable pages for the user.  There are a few
    properties which impact pagination behavior.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Default Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>pagination</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>If true, rows are paginated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>pageSize</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>This is how many rows are shown per page</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
    If the last page does not contain enough rows to fill the page, empty rows are shown so the table has a uniform
    height.  This keeps the pagination controls from jumping up and down as the user moves between pages.
</div>
