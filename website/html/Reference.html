<h3>Table Columns</h3>

<p>
    The columns are defined in the <code>columns</code> property to DuxTable as an array of JavaScript objects.  The
    objects have several optional properties and only one required property: <code>title</code>.  Here is a list of
    the properties followed by an example of a columns array in use.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th width="150">Default Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>title</td>
        <td>(required)</td>
        <td>The title of the column shown in the column header</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>field</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This is the field in the row object to render in the cell.  In the above example, this could be
            <code>Name</code> or <code>Email</code>.  If no custom rendering is necessary, this is the easiest way
            to display cell contents.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>render</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This property specifies a function to call to render the cell contents.  The function is passed the object
            for the row from the array provided in the <code>data</code> property.  It can return a string or a
            React component.  See the topic on Custom Cell Rendering for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>align</td>
        <td>left</td>
        <td>This specifies the text alignment in the cell: "left", "center", or "right".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>width</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            DuxTable automatically calculates column sizes based on the width of the table. This property specifies
            the width in pixels of the column.  Columns without a specified width are sized equally.  The user is
            allowed to resize columns by dragging the divider in the column header.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sortable</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>
            By setting this property to false, the user will not be allowed to click in the column header to sort the
            table by this column.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sortCallback</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            If present, this function will be called when the user clicks on the column header to sort the table by
            this column.  See the topic on Row Sorting for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>footer</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>
            This specifies a value or React component to render as a footer for this column.  See the topic on Footers
            for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
